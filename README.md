# Statement of Understanding: Effectiveness of the Term Deposit Campaign

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bank’s term deposit marketing campaign by predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and transactional characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to:
	1.	Identify Key Predictors: Understand which client attributes and behavioral factors most strongly influence the likelihood of subscription.
	2.	Predict Outcomes: Develop predictive models using k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to classify whether a client will subscribe.
	3.	Compare Model Performance: Assess the performance of each classifier based on evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and identify the best-performing model.
	4.	Provide Actionable Insights: Translate the findings into actionable recommendations for the bank to improve future campaign strategies.

# Business Impact

By accurately predicting subscription outcomes, the bank can target its marketing efforts more effectively, reducing costs while increasing the likelihood of reaching clients who are most likely to subscribe to term deposits.

## Data Results

### Descriptive Stats

#### Demographic Features:

Age: The average age is around 40 years, with the majority of customers in the 25–45 age group. There are fewer customers in the younger (<25) and older (65+) age groups.
Marital Status: Most customers are married, followed by single individuals. Divorced customers form the smallest group.
Education: Tertiary education has the highest success rate for subscribing to term deposits, suggesting education level may influence interest.

#### Socioeconomic Features:

Job: Customers in certain job categories like “retired” and “students” have higher success rates, suggesting targeting based on job type can improve campaign effectiveness.
Loan & Housing: Customers without housing loans or personal loans show higher success rates. This suggests a potential focus on financially independent customers.

### Inferential Stats

#### Association Between Features and Subscription:

Features such as job, marital status, education, and loan status appear to have significant associations with subscription rates. For instance:
- Retired individuals are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
- Higher education levels (tertiary) are positively correlated with subscriptions.
- Customers without personal or housing loans tend to subscribe more.

#### Age Groups:

Subscription rates are higher for older customers (65+), suggesting age may play a role in decision-making for long-term financial products.

## Recommendations

- Focus marketing campaigns on customers who are retired, highly educated, and financially independent.
- Tailor communication strategies for different age groups, especially emphasizing the benefits of term deposits for older customers (65+).
- Consider designing specific campaigns for single and tertiary-educated individuals, as these groups have higher success rates.
