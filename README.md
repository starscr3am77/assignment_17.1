# Statement of Understanding: Effectiveness of the Term Deposit Campaign

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bankâ€™s term deposit marketing campaign by predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and transactional characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to:
	1.	Identify Key Predictors: Understand which client attributes and behavioral factors most strongly influence the likelihood of subscription.
	2.	Predict Outcomes: Develop predictive models using k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines to classify whether a client will subscribe.
	3.	Compare Model Performance: Assess the performance of each classifier based on evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and identify the best-performing model.
	4.	Provide Actionable Insights: Translate the findings into actionable recommendations for the bank to improve future campaign strategies.

# Business Impact

By accurately predicting subscription outcomes, the bank can target its marketing efforts more effectively, reducing costs while increasing the likelihood of reaching clients who are most likely to subscribe to term deposits.
